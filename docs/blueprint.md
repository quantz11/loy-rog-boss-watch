## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, mysterious purple (#6A498E), inspired by the magical and strategic world of Legend of Ymir. This captures the essence of the game environment and creates an immersive user experience.
- Background color: Soft lavender (#E6E0EB), a desaturated version of the primary purple, providing a gentle contrast that is easy on the eyes and highlights the timer elements.
- Accent color: Vibrant cyan (#4CD0E2), to draw attention to important elements like active timers and input fields. This analogous hue complements the purple while providing a necessary visual pop.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will ensure a modern, readable, and objective presentation of timer data and game information. This choice aids clarity and efficiency for users checking boss respawn times.
- Use icons to represent each floor and boss, providing a visual cue for quick identification.
- Organize timers in a clear, tabular format, grouped by floor and server type, ensuring easy navigation and readability.
- Subtle animations to indicate when a boss is about to respawn or when a new time is set, adding a dynamic feel to the app.
